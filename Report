Thease are the times of execution for each scheduling ran 4 different times:

                            RR:   2002 2004 2002 2004       Avg.run time = 2003.00
                            FCFS: 2172 2181 2198 2190       Avg.run time = 2185.25
                            PBS:  2008 2007 2008 2009       Avg.run time = 2008.00
                            MLFQ: 2004 2005 2003 2004       Avg.run time = 2004.00

Analysis:
    RR, PBS, MLFQ takes least time for execution than that of FCFS. All schedulings except FCFS takes almost all same time. 
    As FCFS is non-preemptive it's execution time is much higher.
    Here RR and MLFq are more effective than PBS during i/o and cpu time.

Exploiting in MLFQ by a process:
    A process can exploit this by intentionally relinquishing control to cpu just before the completion of last tick for this process,
    and get inserted in the same queue with the values reset to default. Thus remain in the same queue for entire execution and is given high priority
    than remaining processes.
